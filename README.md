TLDR: Starting with robots playing soccer is too complicated.


## Motivation

Let's start with the objective of the RoboCup:

> By the middle of the 21st century, a team of fully autonomous humanoid robot soccer players shall win a soccer game, complying with the official rules of FIFA, against the winner of the most recent World Cup. 
 
*Source: [robocup.org](https://www.robocup.org/objective)*

To achieve this ambitious goal in the remaining 28 years, the rules are tightened every year to bring them in line with those of FIFA. 
In addition, it's essential to motivate young researchers to participate, which is why schoolchildren are already developing robots in RoboCup Junior.
After more than 20 years of RoboCup Junior, such a high technical level has now been reached that it is extremely difficult for newcomers to enter the competition.
Therefore there is a standard league since 2014 (at least in Germany), in which the robots may only be built with LEGO or fischertechnik.

To get started with RoboCup Junior Soccer many teams used the LEGO MINDSTORMS kit. But currently there is the problem that Lego has retired the MINDSTORMS EV3 (*Source: [legoeducation.com](https://community.legoeducation.com/blogs/36/95)*).
For the successor LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor neither IR sensor nor camera are available, which are however indispensable for participation.
The reason for this is that the new Robot Inventor app does not yet offer the option of integrating non-official sensor blocks. 
It's unclear whether LEGO will ever change this.

## Our Proposal

Notes:
* we want a platform to get a easy access to robocup junior soccer
* this should be susitainable and not depending on company interests/decisions
    * therefore open source / open hardware

## What we NOT want

* a ready-to-play robot
    * TODO: explain deeper
    * just library software
    * no program "how to play soccer"
    * just electronic/hardware(adapter) kits, soldering / mounting still needed
* a perfect system which outperforms current world champions
    * TODO: explain deeper

## Schedule

1. developing basic components, test it with some teams in lightweight / open league
2. Let teams gain experience and incorporate it into the project.
3. convince the german committee for admission in the standard league

## Who we are

We are a group of former participants, coaches, referees, volunteers of RoboCupJunior Soccer. 
We are not a company and have no commercial interest. 
However, we are thinking about founding a non-profit organization at some point in order to be able to distribute the robot parts developed here as kits at cost price. 

## Call for Contribution

do this is in "our proposal"?

## Notes
* NO commercial goals at all
* Beginner friendliness already today big step between Lego and own electronics
* Big teams have it anyways
* Everything is open source technical and communication -> everybody can contribute
* Project does NOT provide software, only libraries
* Project provides only plans/layout for electronics and omniwheels


## TODO

* [ ] check (R) on all Logos
* [ ] check spelling of LEGO, fischetechnik, Robocup
* [ ] TLDR
