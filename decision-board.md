# Decision Board

## What Bruno should look like

At some point the first Bruno will be built and before that a lot of decisions have to be made. How should its individual components be designed?
Here is an overview (in keywords) of the discussed advantages and
disadvantages of the different given options.

**Important:**
This document is (of course) not complete.
It has to be further developed, depending on the state of development, in order to get finally a complete picture of the components.

**to do:**

- For each point,
  - the pros and cons are needed (in keywords).
  - a decision is needed.


## Chassis

### Size

*No decision here, every team has to decide and construct for their own.*

### Number of wheels

*No decision here, every team has to decide and construct for their own.*



## Electronic
### Logic Voltage

The logic voltage level should be 5V.  
**or**  
The logic voltage level should be 3.3V. 

**pros:**

**cons:**

**decision:**

### Motor Voltage

The motor voltage level should be limited to 9V.  
**or**  
The motor voltage level should not be limited (maximum: battery voltage).

**pros:**

**cons:**

**decision:**

### CPU

Use of a single board chip (like Arduino Nano, Rasberry Pico, ...)  
**or**  
Build or own. 

**pros:**

**cons:**

**decision:**


### Components

Only THT components should be used.  
**or**  
THT and SMD components should be used.

**pros:**

**cons:**

**decision:**

### PCB design

There should be a minimum linewith (of ??mm) and a minimum spacing (of ??mm) between the tracks so that it is possible to etch or mill the PCB at home.

**pros:**

**cons:**

**decision:**
