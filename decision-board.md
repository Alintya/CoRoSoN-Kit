# **What Bruno should look like**

At some point the first Bruno will be built and before that a lot of decisions have to be made. How should its individual components be designed?
Here is an overview (in keywords) of the discussed advantages and
disadvantages of the different given options. 

**Important:**  
This document is (of course) not complete.
It has to be further developed, depending on the state of development, in order to get finally a complete picture of Bruno.

**to do:**  
- For each point, the pros and cons are needed (in keywords).  
- A decision is needed for each point.   


*(As an example I started with the size.)*




# Chassis

## Size 
Bruno is of round shape and should have a diameter of 18cm (22cm).

**pros:**  
- suitable for each legue

**cons:**   
- easy to construct  
- kicking-device easier integrable  

**decision:**  
(initially) both as variants  
(wird endg√ºltig ab: *Datum*)

## Number of wheels
Bruno should drive with three (four) individual controllable wheels.  

**pros:**  

**cons:**    

**decision:**  


## Stability

The main PCB is part of the chassis and essential for stability.

**pros:**  

**cons:**    

**decision:**  

## Room for 'kicking-device'
Enough room for a 'kicking-device', to be built in later, should be part of the construction.

**pros:**  

**cons:**    

**decision:**  


# Sensors

## ball

## gyroscope

## line

## distance

# Actuators

## motors

## kicking-device

## dribbling-device

# Electronic

## CPU

- Arduino Nano

- Rasberry Pi Pico
-  ???


## Components

Only THT components should be used.  
THT and SMD components should be used.

**pros:**  

**cons:**    

**decision:**  

## PCB design
There should be a minimum linewith (of ??mm) and a minimum spacing (of ??mm) between the tracks so that it is possible to etch or mill the PCB at home.

**pros:**  

**cons:**    

**decision:**
